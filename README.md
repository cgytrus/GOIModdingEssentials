Stuff you need to start modding Getting Over It with BepInEx

# How to use
Download and install [BepInEx](https://bepinex.github.io/bepinex_docs/master/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) first

download the latest archive (GOIModdingEssentials.zip), 
extract the folder from it to `game's folder/BepInEx/plugins`,
download and install [BepInEx.ConfigurationManager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager/releases) the same way 
(put the dll right into the `plugins` folder, no need to put it in another folder)
